                I've been using computers my whole life. I remember my dad letting me take apart one of his 
                old computers when I was 3 or 4. I played games on the old family MS-DOS computer (Commander 
                Keen was one of my favorites). I went from MS-DOS to Windows 3.1, to 95, to 98, to XP, on and on.
                I had plenty of hardware, software, networking, and troubleshooting experience. As such, I was 
                normally the one people came to when they had issues with any piece of tech, new or old.  
            </p>
            <p class="bodyp" id="p2">
                However, when it came to coding/programming, I had almost no experience. I tried several times to 
                do projects with maker tech things, like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, but quickly learned that 
                I need to know at least something about programming to really be able to do much with them. Most of what I 
                was able to do was based off of very specific tutorials, or straight up reuse of someone elses code.

                I had taken basic HTML/CSS in college, and had made a website or two on my own as a hobby. I initally used
                Codecademy to try to learn Python, and made it through the course in a few weeks. However, I
                didn't use it much. I tried to make a few tools for my job, they didn't work too well, and I ended up dropping it a 
                few months later. I had never been in a devoted classroom atmosphere for an object oriented 
                programming language, which I greatly desired. I learn better in a classroom, so I was just waiting 
                for LC101 applications to open.

                I am really looking forward to Unit 3. Until now, the topics we've covered in LC101 have been topics
                I've covered before at some point. I am hoping that I am able to join the Java portion of the class. 
                I've never thought of myself as being too great at design, so the back-end coding has always interested me. 
                I like making things work, finding creative solutions to problems, and sometimes just trying several different
                methods until something finally works. From there I can clean it up, but initially that means my code can get 
                pretty messy at times.
